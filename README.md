# SENTRY
Sentry (Experimental, WIP) an LLM-based OSINT data-fusion program.
Core components include an async web data retrieval toolkit built with aiohttp to efficiently fetch web-hosted content, forming the ingestion layer for bulk crawling and document parsing pipelines. Current focus is on core async download functionality, with structured bulk processing, parsing, and fusion extensions in progress.
